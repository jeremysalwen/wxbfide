 *  Terminal Widget
 *
 *  To handle user input to the terminal, inherit this
 *  class and override the OnUserInput
 *
 *  To make the widget display new characters sent from your backend,
 *  use DisplayChars (or you may use DisplayCharsUnsafe, if you are
 *  calling from within the main event loop.
